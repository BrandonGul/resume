        <a href="https://brandongul.github.io/ac-critterpedia/">ac-critterpedia</a> 2020.<br>
        This is a guide for Nintendo's popular game Animal Crossing New Horizons. <br><br>
        One of the main aspects of the game is to collect and aquire a diverse selection of creatures that appear at differnt times and dates in the game. Keeping track of this can very difficult!<br>
        My goal was to make this a simple endevoir. Unlike other guides this is styleized to memic the games menu's making it easy to hunt down any bug/fish you need.

        <a href="https://www.usernil.com/">usernil.com</a> 2020.<br>
        When I started streaming on twitch I saw numerous moderation bots. While these were definitely good choices I noticed improvements that could be made as far as ease of use and functionality. Also, it was just a good excuse to make something cool.<br><br>
        This is a really great project in my eyes. It taught me a lot about web design, server infrastructure, NoSQL databases and apiâ€™s. Definitely a highlight of my year!

        <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> 2017-2020.<br>
        I worked as a barista at Starbucks from August 2017 to May 2020. The lessons and experience I have gained from working at Starbuck have been very valuble to me. Everything from interacting and getting to know the customers, understanding the workflow and enviorment to building great relationships with my coworkers. These are all lessons I will be able to utilize going forward.

        <a href="https://brandongul.github.io/TORA/index.html">TORA: Reminder</a>. 2015-2016.<br>
        TORA was my first solo application development project. The goal was to create a minimalistic reminder application that was as easy to use as it was beautiful. The application creates timers or alarms based on the users text input. I am very proud of how this application combines design and functionality so seamlessly.

        <a>SeaBird</a>. 2014.<br>
        SeaBird is a collaborative iOS game that I worked on over the summer of 2014. During development, I was a part of all aspects of the games creation; from design, gameplay and mechanics. It was an incredible learning experience that resulted in a fantastic game.

        <br><br><br>

        <a href="http://www.littletraversesailors.org/">LTS</a>. 2011-2013. Little Travers Sailors is a nonprofit sailing school in Northern Michigan.<br>
        I worked as a sailing instructor at LTS for three summers between the years of 2011 to 2013.<br><br>
        Having the ability to teach people one of my passions was the most fun part about this job. This was a really hectic and collaborative enviorment that taught me a lot about how to keep a calm composure while maintaining a fun and safe learning enviorment.
