        <a href="https://brandongul.github.io/ac-critterpedia/">ac-critterpedia</a> Summer 2020.<br>
        This is a guide for Nintendo's popular game Animal Crossing New Horizons.
        <br><br>
        One of the main aspects of the game is to collect and aquire a diverse selection of creatures that appear at differnt times and dates in the game. Keeping track of this can very difficult!
        <br>
        My goal was to make this a simple endevoir. Unlike other guides this is styleized to memic the games menu's making it easy to hunt down any bug/fish you need.

        <a href="https://www.usernil.com/">usernil.com</a> Spring 2020.<br>
        When I started streaming on twitch I saw numerous moderation bots. While these were definitely good choices I noticed improvements that could be made as far as ease of use and functionality. Also, it was just a good excuse to make something cool.
        <br><br>
        This is a really great project in my eyes. It taught me a lot about web design, server infrastructure, NoSQL databases and apiâ€™s. Definitely a highlight of my year!

        <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> Summer 2017-Spring 2020.<br>
          I worked as a barista at Starbucks from August 2017 to May 2020. The lessons and experience I have gained from working at Starbuck have been very valuble to me. Everything from interacting and getting to know the customers, understanding the workflow and enviorment to building great relationships with my coworkers. These are all lessons I will be able to utilize going forward.<br><br><br>

        <a href="https://brandongul.github.io/TORA/index.html">TORA: Reminder</a>. Winter 2015-Summer 2016.<br>
          TORA was my first solo application development project. The goal was to create a minimalistic reminder application that was as easy to use as it was beautiful. The application creates timers or alarms based on the users text input. I am very proud of how this application combines design and functionality so seamlessly.<br><br><br>

        <a>SeaBird</a>. Spring 2014-Summer 2014.<br>
          SeaBird is a collaborative iOS game that I worked on over the summer of 2014. During development, I was a part of all aspects of the games creation; from design, gameplay and mechanics. It was an incredible learning experience that resulted in a fantastic game.<br><br><br>

        <a href="http://www.littletraversesailors.org/">LTS</a>. Summer 2013. Little Travers Sailors is a nonprofit sailing school in Northern Michigan.<br>
          This Year I was offered an opportunity to learn advanced sailboat racing under Dan Thompson, a sailing coach from Hobart College in Geneva, New York. Within three months my sailboat racing skills increased exponentially; I became more receptive to my surroundings, and a better instructor overall.<br><br><br>

        <a href="http://www.littletraversesailors.org/">LTS</a>. Summer 2012.<br>
          I was given more responsibility to teach entire classes and help in curriculum creation and management. Classes consisted of an average of 5-10 students ages ranging from 8-18.<br><br><br>

        <a href="http://www.littletraversesailors.org/">LTS</a>. Summer 2011.<br>
          This was the first year that I worked at LTS. I worked as an instructor, on the water, teaching students of all skill levels. I worked teaching proper boat handling and techniques, with an emphasis on safety. Teaching sailing can at time be very stressful, It was important for me to learn how to have a calm and professional demeanor during difficult situations.
